                        My work is an expression of my experience of places. I paint from memory which helps me to
                        unpick the emotional imprint of a place rather than conveying it as it is. Iâ€™m interested in pushing
                        the boundaries of abstraction, manipulating paint by layering, sanding, playing with temperature
                        and light to create an atmosphere in works. I want to leave enough space developed through
                        subtle abstraction of colour and form to allow a viewer to impart their experiences onto the
                        scene. I like the idea that my work may feel familiar, that a mass of colour might appear to be a
                        ridgeline, a cloud or perhaps an indication of a tree and that these interpretations may shift as a
                        viewer connects with and moves around my artwork.

                        I began my art career as a watercolourist. I'm incredibly fond of its ability to surprise, its
                        unruliness and the delicate nature of it. I also love paper and how different fibres impact how
                        watercolour spreads and bleeds. I like this paradox, that no matter how much control I exert,
                        watercolour surprises and the marks left are an echo of this relationship: of me and forces of
                        nature. I also simultaneously developed my practice as an oil painter. Oil offers a depth of colour
                        and weight that watercolour can not match. Oil paint provided a way of painting that overcame
                        some of the limitations of watercolour, particularly enabling vibrancy and depth of colour and
                        texture to my works. I wanted to marry these two elements together: the delicacy of watercolour, its
                        nuances in light and its ability to surprise, with the depth of colour and control that oil provides.
                        With this, I developed over four years a clay ground recipe. The clay behaves like paper when
                        wet, so the watercolour bleeds as if it was on cotton rag but unlike paper is extremely tolerant to
                        scraping, sanding, rubbing and heat. This allows my works to be built up then erased to leave trace
                        marks of forms. The clay is also an excellent base for oil paint, where texture can be developed
                        through both paints and within the ground itself.
