# Laura Dennis Studio & Gallery

[View the live project here](https://teerapat-bickerton.github.io/Laura-Dennis-Studio/)

In this project I wanted to help a friend who had recently opened a studio and art gallery, but her website wasn’t quite up to scratch. I wanted to create a webpage that would be a portal for Laura to showcase her work and help her to connect to more potential clients.

The webpage would be aimed at people who are interested in art, collectors, people seeking to commission new work or people visiting the beautiful Brecon Beacons hoping to see some local artists at work.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Header & Navigation Bar

* Featured on all five pages, the header will include the fully responsive navigation bar links of the Logo, Home, The Art, Workshops, Makers Corner and Laura, with each page containing the same corresponding feature. The header on the landing page will also contain a large image of Laura's gallery which will take up a large portion of the screen.
* This navigation bar will make it easy to navigate the site with an intuitive layout and without the user having to press the back button. The landing image should immediately help give the user an understanding and feeling for Laura’s gallery.

### Laura's Aesthetic Ethos Gallery

* When users scroll down the page, I want them to get a feeling of what Laura’s artwork is about and the place where she creates her it.
* In this section, rather than having lots of words trying to explain her aesthetic, I want to have lots of smaller photographs of Laura’s artwork in the context of her surroundings and in the mediums she uses.

### Footer 

* This section will include the address of the studio as well as a contact number, and links to all relevant social media sites and will appear at the bottom of each page. 
* This will be valuable for potential clients to keep connected and updated to Laura’s artwork, as well as allowing clients to contact her.

## Future Features to Implement

* I would like to, when I have the skillset, implement an e-commerce platform, specifically to the Makers Corner section, though could be added to all of her work in the future. 

# User Experience (UX)

## User stories

* First Time User Goals
    * As a first time user I want to be able instantly see and understand what the main purpose of the site is and what it is about.
    * As a first time visitor I would like to easily walk through the site with ease and find all the content.
    * As a first time user I want to find out more about Laura's work and Laura herself. I would also like to link up Laura's social media sites and understand her aesthetic.
* Returning Visitor Goals
    * As a returning visitor, I want to see if Laura has painted any new artworks.
    * As a returning visitor, I want to find out about workshops.
    * As a returning visitor, I want to find out about other Welsh artists and artisans.
* Frequent User Goals

## Design 

* Colour Scheme
    * The two main colours are a dark green rgb(84, 92, 92) and pale eggshell blue rgb(225, 240, 240) that was chosen by Laura. 
* Typography
    * The Source Sans Pro and Roboto fonts are the main fonts used throughout the websites, with Helvetica and sans-serif used as back-ups in case the fonts can't be loaded by the browser. Source Sans Pro was chosen by Laura and Roboto was recommended as a complimentary font on Google Fonts, they are both clear, legible and modern.
* Imagery 
    * Imagery is vital, especially for a Artist's gallery website. The large landing image gives you a feel of what it is like to walk in to Laura's gallery. Images throughout the website are meant to draw the user in and get an understanding of who Laura is what is her style.

# Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

* W3C Markup Validator Results

![W3C Markup validator results](assets/images/validator-html.jpg)

It showed a warning for not having a header on the aesthetic ethos gallery on the landing page, I chose not to add one, as I thought it would go against the aesthetic of the page.

* W3C CSS Validator Results

![W3C CSS validator results](assets/images/validator-css.jpg)

It showed five warnings for font that had whitespace and not quoted and five warnings for hr lines color and background-color which were the same, these have all been corrected now.

## Further Testing

* The website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox a Quora. It was not not tested on Safari as non of my family or friends have any Apple products.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as a Desktop, Laptop, Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro, Samsung A70 and Samsung A5.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages are linking correctly.
* A few friends and family have trialed out the website to see if they could find any issues.

## Known bugs

* There are no known bugs at the moment, however I was experimenting with trying to implement a hamburger using javascript, however there were too many errors, so I decided to delete it all.
