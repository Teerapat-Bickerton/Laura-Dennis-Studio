# Laura Dennis Studio & Gallery

[View the live project here](https://teerapat-bickerton.github.io/Laura-Dennis-Studio/)

In this project I wanted to help a friend who had recently opened a studio and art gallery, but her website wasn’t quite up to scratch. I wanted to create a webpage that would be a portal for Laura to showcase her work and help her to connect to more potential clients.

The webpage would be aimed at people who are interested in art, collectors, people seeking to commission new work or people visiting the beautiful Brecon Beacons hoping to see some local artists at work.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Header & Navigation Bar

* Featured on all five pages, the header will include the fully responsive navigation bar links of the Logo, Home, The Art, Workshops, Makers Corner and Laura, with each page containing the same corresponding feature. The header on the landing page will also contain a large image of Laura's gallery which will take up a large portion of the screen.
* This navigation bar will make it easy to navigate the site with an intuitive layout and without the user having to press the back button. The landing image should immediately help give the user an understanding and feeling for Laura’s gallery.

### Laura's Aesthetic Ethos Gallery

* When users scroll down the page, I want them to get a feeling of what Laura’s artwork is about and the place where she creates her it.
* In this section, rather than having lots of words trying to explain her aesthetic, I want to have lots of smaller photographs of Laura’s artwork in the context of her surroundings and in the mediums she uses.

### Footer 

* This section will include the address of the studio as well as a contact number, and links to all relevant social media sites and will appear at the bottom of each page. 
* This will be valuable for potential clients to keep connected and updated to Laura’s artwork, as well as allowing clients to contact her.

## Future Features to Implement

* I would like to, when I have the skillset, implement an e-commerce platform, specifically to the Makers Corner section, though could be added to all of her work in the future.

## Design 

* Colour Scheme
    * The two main colours are a dark green rgb(84, 92, 92) and pale eggshell blue rgb(225, 240, 240) that was chosen by Laura. 
* Typography
    * The Source Sans Pro and Roboto fonts are the main fonts used throughout the websites, with Helvetica and sans-serif used as back-ups in case the fonts can't be loaded by the browser. Source Sans Pro was chosen by Laura and Roboto was recommended as a complimentary font on Google Fonts, they are both clear, legible and modern.
* Imagery 
    * Imagery is vital, especially for a Artist's gallery website. The large landing image gives you a feel of what it is like to walk in to Laura's gallery. Images throughout the website are meant to draw the user in and get an understanding of who Laura is what is her style.
